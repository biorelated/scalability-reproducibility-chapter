Nextflow is a workflow manager and pipeline orchestrator built on the data flow paradigm [1]. Nextflow is written in Groovy and defines a very powerful and concise domain specific language (DSL) to describe processes and channels. The formers are where task execution is defined, the latters are the way in which inputs and outputs are passed from one process to the others in the same workflow. In the DSL many commands and methods are available for common use cases in bioinformatics, including for instance sequences file splitting, files searching and grouping by name, along with standard operators to allow manipulations of lists and collections. Nextflow is also very flexible allowing task itselves to be defined in multiple languages, including Bash, Python, Ruby, Groovy and others.
Nextflow and the data flow paradigm are based on a "push" concept, the first process in the workflow will send his outputs over to the following processes that will wait for the data to arrive before starting their computation. It is the closest representation of a "pipeline" idea, where at the beginning you open the valve and watch the flow progressing through the pipes. Nextflow can handle this data flow in a parallel and asynchronous manner, meaning that a process can operate on multiple inputs and emit multiple outputs at the same time. In a simple workflow where, for instance, there are 100 sequences to be aligned with the NCBI NT database using Blast, a first process can compute the alignment on the 100 sequences in parallel, while a second process will wait to receive and collect the output of the 100 alignments to create a final results file. Nextflow can run the same workflow locally or using a computing cluster (common schedulers like SLURM, PBS, LSF, SGE are supported) or run directly into the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud.
In order to run the Nextflow example you need to have at least Java 8 available on your system and Docker, then to install Nextflow it is sufficient to run these commands:

cd $HOME 
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash

Once Nextflow is installed, to run the example:

cd scalability-reproducibility-chapter/Nextflow
~/nextflow run workflow.nf -with-docker springer/scalability
